Task 1: Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan
Objective: Scan a network for vulnerabilities to identify potential security risks.

Details:
Utilized tools such as Nmap to perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan on a designated network.
The scan focused on identifying open ports, services running, and potential vulnerabilities associated with these services.
Review and Interpretation:
Analyzed scan results to determine security weaknesses.
Prioritized vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact on the network.
Recommended mitigation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities.



Task 2: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Objective: Enhance the security of personal accounts by enabling two-factor authentication.

Details:
Enabled 2FA on various personal accounts, including email and social media platforms.
Utilized an authenticator app or hardware token to provide an additional layer of security during the login process.
Documented the setup process and best practices for maintaining secure access to accounts.



Task 3: Analyze Network Traffic
Objective: Monitor and analyze network traffic to understand traffic patterns and protocol usage.

Details:
Employed Wireshark to capture network packets and perform detailed analysis of the traffic.
Identified common network protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP) and their corresponding traffic patterns.
Analyzed the data to detect anomalies or suspicious activities, contributing to overall network security assessment.
